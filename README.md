# ShimmerTest
## Build Instructions

This project uses CocoaPods as the dependency manager. Even though this repository contains the third-party libraries included via CocoaPods, it might be necessary to run the command 'pod install' on terminal to install all the dependencies.
After installing all the dependencies, it's necessary to open the file ShimmerTest.xcworkspace on Xcode to run the project.
